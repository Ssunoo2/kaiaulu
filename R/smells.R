#' Estimates Socio-Technical Congruence
#'
#' @description Socio-technical congruence (st.congruence) is measured as the
#' number of development collaborations that do have a communication counterpart
#' over the total number of collaboration links present in the collaboration
#' Developer Social Network. Development collaborations that do have a
#' communication counterpart are identified analysing one by one the collaboration
#' links that connect different developers present in the collaboration Developer
#' Social Network and check within the communication Developer Social Network if
#' such developers are present and connected through a communication link.
#' Therefore, socio-technical congruence can be computed using Missing Links
#' Community Smell metric as follows:
#'
#' st_congruence = (n_collaborations - n_missing_links)/n_collaborations
#'
#' @param mail.graph A uni-modal network G = (V,E), where V are
#' developers (authors or contributors) and E is a collaboration between developers
#' in the mailing list
#' @param code.graph A uni-modal network G = (V,E), where V are
#' developers (authors or contributors) and E is a collaboration between developers
#' in the git log.

#' Mean value of Decision Communicability.
#'
#' @description Each collaboration between two developers (A and B) in the
#' software development network is considered as a possible source of
#' architectural and design decision, therefore a developer is considered
#' aware of a decision if he or she is strongly connected to at least one
#' of the two developers whom generated the decision. In-communicability
#' is related to every collaboration within the collaboration DSN and it
#' is based on Tamburri et al.â€™s formulation:
#'
#' MAI = DEM - DAM
#'
#' DEM = n_collaborators_of_two_developers/n_developers
#'
#' DAM = n_collaborators_of_two_developers_who_communicate_with_them/n_developers
#'
#' Therefore, global in-communicability can be defined as the mean MAI over
#' the entire collaboration network. Communicability is a global indicator
#' which consists n the mean of all local communicability measures, calculated
#' for every collaboration between two developers within the collaboration
#' Developer Social Network in the range in analysis.
#' Communicability was preferred to in-communicability in order to simplify
#' measurement comprehension, because in-communicability tend to be characterised
#' by measurements that tend to zero. Communicability is computed as:
#'
#' (1 - mean(incommunicability))
